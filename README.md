# BinPython
Binary Python: An esoteric language.. Which is indeed a brother of python, but in BINARY!

get a nice hello world:
```
01110000011100100110100101101110011101000010100000100010010010000110010101101100011011000110111100101100001000000101011101101111011100100110110001100100001000010010001000101001
```
output:
```
Hello, World!
```

How to use main executable?
<br>
<br>
```
binpython.exe --python [python-file]
```
^^ this converts python into binpython
<hr>
```
binpython.exe -e [binpython file]
```
^^ this converts (exports) binpython to python
<hr>
```
binpython.exe -o [binpython file]
```
^^ this runs binpython file..
<hr>

# BINPYTHON RULES:
All characters other than 0 and 1 are ignored and are comments
All codes are python codes converted into its binary equivalent

<hr>
funny thing:

The main program is indeed, written in Binary-python ITSELF!
